The oai-comp library is a tool that allows content providers to provide OAI-PMH enabled feeds for their metadata sources. Given the fact that many organisations are not able to provide their metadata in an OAI-PMH format, this tool is very useful for enabling OAI harvesting of their metadata that can be used by harvesters feeding Europeana.

It is actually an implementation of the Biblio Transformation Engine Tool (<a href="https://github.com/EKT/Biblio-Transformation-Engine">https://github.com/EKT/Biblio-Transformation-Engine</a>) along with a sample oai webapp application (based on OCLC OAI server) that combined together provide OAI-PMH feeds to a DSpace repository and a Z39-50 server. However, user can extend functionality to support other legacy data sources.
